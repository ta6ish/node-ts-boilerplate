# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Install dev dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install -D
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!

## Testing
For this project, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is our test framework.

### Install the components
To add TypeScript + Jest support, first install a few npm packages:
```
npm install -D jest ts-jest
```
`jest` is the testing framework itself, and `ts-jest` is just a simple function to make running TypeScript tests a little easier.

### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

### Running ESLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke ESLint.
To run ESLint you can call the main build script or just the ESLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including ESLint
npm run lint    // runs only ESLint
```
